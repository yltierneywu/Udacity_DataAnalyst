# Udacity_DataAnalyst

These are the notebooks that I created as part of the Udacity course "Data Analyst" that I successfully completed March 2021. There were five different projects:

1. Exploring weather trends
The project consisted of the following steps:
a. Extracting the city level and global data from the database with an SQL query and exporting it to a csv-file. 
b. Calculating the moving average of the temperature and comparing the city of choice - in my case Amsterdam - with global temperatures in a line chart. It was allowed to use any tool to do this, e.g. Excel or google sheets, but to practise my skills in Python I decided to do this in a Jupyter notebook.
c. Make observations about the similarities and differences between global averages and Amsterdam temperature trends.
In this repository you can find the csv-file, the Jupyter notebook and a write-up of my observations.

2. Investigating a dataset
This project was about investigating a dataset of choice. Out of the [options](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/July/5b57919a_data-set-options/data-set-options.pdf) I selected the [European soccer dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer). There was not fixed set of questions to answer. I came up with the following questions to answer:
a. Do teams score more when they play at home or when they play away?
b. Is that the same for all leagues?
c. Is the number of goals per match the same for each league? Any observations of the number of goals per team?
d. Is the total number of goals the same for each month of the year and season?
In this repository you can find the data that I extracted from the database with an SQL query and saved as a csv-file, and the Jupyter notebook with the analysis and observations in markdown

3. Analyzing A/B test results
A template Jupyter notebook was provided. In this repository you can find my final notebook after filling in the blanks.
